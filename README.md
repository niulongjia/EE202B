### Project Description
In our project, we discuss and quantitatively evaluate the capability of digital electricity meters to be used for human occupancy/human activities prediction in various models based on ECO Data-set house#2. Given the fact that digital meters are widely installed and does not impose additional costs on the residents, there are huge opportunities to implement it on real automation systems.

### ECO Dataset
ECO ( Electricity Consumption and Occupancy) data set is the first data set available that contains both electricity consumption and ground truth occupancy information of households.   
The data collection and analysis are done by the team of prof. Wilhelm Kleiminger, their work is available through:
